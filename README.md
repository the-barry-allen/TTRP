# TTRP
## Inspiration
What is the one event where you absolutely **have** to buy something for someone. It's a birthday! We saw this really interesting problem about using hyper personalisation to boost TikTok shop and bring it out of its little tab to the whole app.

We realised that introducing Tik-Tok shop as the most convenient way to buy your friends gifts, would be the most natural and effective form of hyper-personalised shopping.

## What it does
During account creation, Tik-Tok requires user's enter their Date of Birth, A nice benefit of that is that TikTok's vast database knows exactly when all your friend's birthdays are about to come up.

A few weeks before your friends B'day ðŸŽ‰ a card with your friend's face pops up telling you that thier birthday is coming soon. The secret sauce is have 3 reccomendations based on my friends activity show up on that card as well along with a Call to Action to look for more gifts.

However the real magic takes place when they click on the button, a custom shopping page is created just for that friend, _**Kushal's custom shopping page!**_ (Kushal is one of our amazing team members and close friend)

Now this page is highly refined, With context from the birthdate, we only show items that could be delivered before the bday. Items that would are preffered as gifts are also more hevily weighted in compared to those that seem like household items like Toilet Paper or soap (These are filtered out)

Based on my friends interest as gathered from browsing habits, this page has certain tabs in the reccomended section, Kushal is a huge football fan and avid player so there's tabs for football accessories, and boots. For someone else who lets say has an interest in cooking, kitchen appliciences would have a tab.

We bring this a level futher by allowing this gift buying to become a shared experince, you can share this custom shopping page with any of your friends and they too can join. Together you can shortlist items into the shortlist section and purchase them later. Together you can also set a budget (per person or together as a group) and the reccomendation algorithm will filter out choices so youll see reccomendations close to your price range.

THe amazing thing is this could be used for a multitude of occasions not just birthdays, maybe Mothers day, Fathers Day, Christmas, Chinese New Year and many more gift giving occaisons.

## How we built it
Building this was an enriching experince full of learning. We started out with a super stong brainstorming session for ideas and as we filtered them out, we found this concept of occasion based cards on your FYP along with these custom shareable shopping pages was super interesting and really effective.

With some basic design on Canva, we divided up tasks and got to coding up a prototype and developing the Technical Design Doc, overtime and as a team we were able to come up with this very project!

## Challenges we ran into
From relentless bugs to design debates there were numerous challenges along the way, but together as a team we really enjoyed slashing them down one at a time. One of them was getting comfortable really documenting out our solution as a TDD, editing it as a team and deciding what should go in and what should be left out.

As computer science students we also took a while to get in tune with the idea of designing UI's with things like a user story in mind but as we collaborated and learnt more this part became really fun and fruitful.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Were really pround of everything we have achived as a team, from the Ideation of our concept of havving occasion based shared shopping pages, that were hyper-personalised to a single person, to designing the writing up a Technical design doc, and then coding up our own prototype.

Were really proud of the good and novel work we did and had an amazing time.

## What we learned
We learnt how immportant communication in a team was to build such a novel project in the time we had. As i look back it amazinlgy evident how we grew as better communicators and team players to build what we did. Additionally, after working on our project i really gained a newfound appreciation for writing up documention, something like a Technical design doc, as a means to really communicate the value a product or a feature can drive to a customer.

## What's next for The Shareable Occasion Based Shopping Page
Were really pround and very excited to see the shareable Occasion bases shopping page that we developed actually be used by user and help them buy gifts for the people they care about.

Moving forwrd, once were able to develop a more polised prototype and integrate a test version with a large database of products from tiktok shop, that plan would be to conduct interative testing on this product, fine tuning the recoomendation algorithms behind it as we hope to one day see its release!
