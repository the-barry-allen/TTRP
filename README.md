# TTRP - The Shareable Occasion Based Shopping Page
This Codebase is a prototype for team _TikTok Rizz Party_'s submission to the TikTok TechJam Hackathon

## About the project (Yayyy)
Hiii! This project was built around the goal of maximising the potential of the TikTok Shop by making it hyper personalised and super effective. We do this by having cards in the for you page that remind you when a close friend's birthday is coming up with very specialised options for that friend.

Clicking on the call to action, then creates a custom shopping page for the occasion (Friends B'day for example) that utlises the data around the friends interest, the delivery date, location, type of occasion and price budget to produce highly relevant and promising reccomendations.

Making these custom pages shareable via a link so groups of friends can access a page makes these custom pages even more power as groups of friends can now shortlist items, look through reccomendations and set a budget!

## Tech specs and How to Run (guide)
To run our codebase, simple pull the repo, open it up on Xcode and run it either on an iOS simulator or an iPhone. Due to time constraints this demo was only built for and tested out on the folowing specs and is reccomended to be ran on this.
- iPhone 15 Pro (Light mode with iOS 17.2)

The parts of the demo that are built up are
- The FYP (here you will see two demo 'video' pages after which kushal's bday card will come up)
- The Custom Shopping Page (Kushal's custom shopping page)
- The default shopping page (to show how a user will swap between the different shopping pages)

There may be limited functionality in some parts of this demo as it is a stand alaong prototype.
